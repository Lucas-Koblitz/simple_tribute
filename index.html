        <h3>How he became a hero to Fluminense fans</h3>
        <h4 class="content">2008</h4>
        <p class="content">Fluminense Football Club gets to the Libertadores Cup final for the first time in the club history. Fluminense won the second leg with a hat-trick of their top scorer. But even so, the brazziliand team lost in the penalty shootout in Rio de Janeiro, leaving the local fans with a trauma that was only solved 15 years later, by a 21 years old boy.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="content">2023, the begining</h4>
        <p class="content">With the consistent work of Fernando Diniz, Fluminense's coach, the year started with the fan's obssession on winning the Libertadores. John Kennedy was considered a doubt in the principal team as he didn't show enough commitment with his football carreer, leading him to play the second division of the Paulist√£o. </p>
        <p class="content">After John Kennedy returned, he showed changes in his training. He wanted do improve. The young player started getting more space to show his skills in the professional team and in each opportunity his performance was never disapointing. 
        
        </p>
        <h4 class="content">2023 Death Matches of Libertadores Cup</h4>
        <p class="content">John Kennedy scored at least a gol in each round of the competition. An impressive feat to a 21 year old who doesn't feel nervous at all, even when he's being watched by thousands of people.  </p>
        <p class="content">The final of this year sounds like a script taken directly from a sports movie. A movie where the protagonist is John Kennedy. Because in a year filled with difficulties, he gets to play for 20 minutes, wich were enough for him. Enough to turn a tense draw against Boca Juniors in a historical win that took the sadness of 2008 out of Fluminense fan's heart, the first continental cup of Fluminense. </p>
